# rnassqs 0.6.4

- incorporate PR from austinwpearce that auto-adjusts call time to meet QuickStats rate limiters

# rnassqs 0.6.3

- Update to work with R 4.4.0

# rnassqs 0.6.2

- Add more testing for http errors, explicit handling of error messages other than 413 and 429.
- Add querying by fips code with `nassqs_fips()` [Issue #30]
- Depends on R(>= 3.5.0) since some test objects are saved in RDS format.

# rnassqs 0.6.1

- Explicit handling for error code 429 has been added.

# rnassqs 0.6.0

- The default download is CSV format instead of JSON to reduce download sizes.
- Additional tests have been added.
- Parameters have been clarified so that only the parameters usable in a query are returned by `nassqs_params()` and `format` is a specific argument to `nassqs()`. Although `CV` and `Value` are returned columns from Quick Stats, they are not queriable parameters.
- By default, `nassqs()` now converts the character `Value` to numeric. Raw character `Value` can be obtained by `as_numeric = FALSE`.
- Documentation for query parameters has been improved and available query parameters are explicit in `nassqs()` now. Functionality is unchanged but parameter names are listed and available in help. Thanks to Robert Dinterman for the initial contribution.
- An option to see valid parameter values given a query of other values in `nassqs_param_values()` has been added.
- `nassqs_record_count()` now validates parameters.
