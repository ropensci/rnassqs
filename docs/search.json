Requests reproducible. rnassqs addresses issues making ‘Quick Stats’ API accessible R code. allows user loop series requests address first issue, execute (perhaps automated schedule) data request repeatedly access new data query address second, make code available allows others reproducibly access data address third. example, currently currently 332,125 records crop yields U.S. counties 2000 2018. Accessing data ‘Quick Stats’ require manually selecting either set years set states reduce request less 50,000 records aggregating data. rnassqs can done : results significant time savings, increases reproducibility data, allows easy updating request new year made available.","code":"# Access yields for all counties and all crops params <- list(sector_desc = \"CROPS\",                group_desc = c(\"FIELD CROPS\", \"FRUIT & TREE NUTS\",                                \"HORTICULTURE\", \"VEGETABLES\"),                statisticcat_desc = \"YIELD\",                 agg_level_desc = \"COUNTY\")  # Get all years from 2000 to 2018 in a list of data.frames data_list <- lapply(2000:2018, function(yr) {    params$year <- yr   rnassqs::nassqs(params, url_only = TRUE) })  # Aggregate the list of data.frames into a single data.frame d <- do.call(\"rbind\", data_list)"},{"path":"/paper.html","id":"alternatives-to-rnassqs","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Alternatives to rnassqs","title":"Summary","text":"USDA-NASS also provides FTP access text data files1. accessing data via FTP users can avoid using selection interface ‘Quick Stats’ avoid limitations number records per request, resolve issues automated repeated requests making data requests reproducible.
